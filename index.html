                <p>For my masters dissertation I hope to use AI to investigate brain functions such as introspection, and begin to speculate how these mechanisms could be implemented in AI architectures to provide valuable steps towards AGI.</p>

                <p>At the end of my final year of biomedical science, I had the opportunity to carry out my dissertation research project, for which I received a first class grade. It was a great experience to work as part of a team with Prof Melanie Madhani and Dr Kayleigh Griffiths. This project helped me gain practical knowledge and experience working as part of a team leading cutting-edge research in cardiovascular medicine. It also opened my eyes to the opportunity artificial intelligence has to impact many areas of healthcare and biomedical science.</p>

                <p>My PhD interview was for an advertised PhD opportunity using machine learning models for the early detection of UGI cancers. As part of the interview process I had to carry out a data analysis report, which included building a logistic regression model and a random forest model. With this being my first fully independent ML project I learnt so much and while my report and analysis was far from perfect, I&apos;m really happy with what I was able to produce in just one week.</p>

                <h4>2023-2024: MSc Computer Science</h4>
                <p>This year I am working towards a masters in computer science at the University of Birmingham. This has really sparked my interest in AI and interdisciplinary research in AI healthcare and neuroscience-inspired AI. I've really enjoyed building strong mathematical foundations in ML, which I hope will enable me to be able to think about more complex algorithms, and how they can be improved by ongoing developments in neuroscience.</p>

                <h4>2020-2023: BSc Biomedical Science</h4>
                <p>Whilst studying biomedical science at the University of Birmingham, I got explore a number of topics in areas such as neuroscience, pharmacology and cardiorespiratory sciences. In the final year of my biomedical science undergraduate degree, I was allocated my first choice optional module of neurotrauma. One of the projects I worked on was the bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs in concussion, led by Dr Valentina Di Pietro. Then at the end of my final year of biomedical science, I went on to complete my dissertation research project, supervised by Melanie Madhani and Kayleigh Griffiths.</p>
