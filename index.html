                <p>At the end of my final year of biomedical science, I had the opportunity to carry out my research project, for which I received a first class grade. It was a great experience to work as part of a team with Prof Melanie Madhani and Dr Kayleigh Griffiths. This project helped me gain practical knowledge and experience working as part of a team leading cutting-edge research in cardiovascular medicine. It also opened my eyes to the opportunity artificial intelligence has to impact many areas of healthcare and biomedical science.</p>

                <p>My PhD interview was for an advertised PhD opportunity using machine learning models for the early detection of UGI cancers. As part of the interview process I had to carry out a data analysis report, which included building a logistic regression model and a random forest model. With this being my first fully independent ML project I learnt so much and while my report and analysis was far from perfect, I&apos;m really happy with what I was able to produce in one week.</p>

                <p>Looking forward to starting my PhD this October at Queen Mary University of London. Outcomes for patients with UGI cancers are poor worldwide, with most patients being diagnosed in late stages, so I'm really excited to be working on this highly impactful project.</p>

                <p>This year I completed my masters in computer science at the University of Birmingham. This has really sparked my interest in AI and interdisciplinary research in AI healthcare and neuroscience-inspired AI. I've really enjoyed building strong mathematical foundations in ML, which I hope will enable me to be able to think about more complex algorithms, and how they can be improved by ongoing developments in neuroscience.</p>

                <p>Whilst studying biomedical science at the University of Birmingham, I got to explore a number of topics in areas such as neuroscience, pharmacology and cardiorespiratory sciences. In the final year of my biomedical science undergraduate degree, I was allocated my first choice optional module of neurotrauma. One of the projects I worked on was the bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs in concussion, led by Dr Valentina Di Pietro. Then at the end of my final year of biomedical science, I went on to complete my research project, supervised by Melanie Madhani and Kayleigh Griffiths.</p>
